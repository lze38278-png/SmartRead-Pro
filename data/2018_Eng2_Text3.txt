Climate change is having a profound impact on wildlife around the world. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events are forcing many species to adapt or face extinction. A study published in the journal Nature found that climate change is already affecting nearly half of all mammal species and a quarter of birds. Some animals are shifting their ranges to cooler areas, while others are changing their behavior, such as altering migration patterns or breeding seasons. However, not all species are able to adapt quickly enough. Polar bears, for example, are struggling to find food as sea ice melts, and many coral reefs are dying due to ocean warming and acidification. Conservationists are working to protect vulnerable species by creating wildlife corridors that allow animals to move to more suitable habitats, and by restoring degraded ecosystems. But scientists warn that these efforts may not be enough if global greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced significantly. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels is crucial to preventing the worst impacts on biodiversity. This will require urgent action from governments, businesses, and individuals worldwide.
