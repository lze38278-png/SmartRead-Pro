For years, studies have found that first-generation college students—those who do not have a parent with a college degree—lag behind other students on a range of education achievement factors. Their grades are lower and their dropout rates are higher. But since such students are most likely to advance economically if they succeed in higher education, colleges and universities have pushed for decades to recruit more of them. This has created a paradox: in trying to expand opportunity, colleges have admitted more first-generation students, but those students often lack the resources and support they need to succeed. A new study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that while first-generation students made up about 30 percent of the undergraduate population in 2012, they accounted for only 20 percent of those who earned a bachelor's degree within six years. The study also found that first-generation students were more likely to come from low-income families, work full-time while enrolled, and be financially independent from their parents. These factors, combined with a lack of academic preparation and social capital, put them at a significant disadvantage. Many colleges have responded by offering special programs to help first-generation students adjust to college life. But critics say these programs are often underfunded and fail to address the root causes of the problem. They argue that colleges need to do more to level the playing field, such as providing better financial aid, academic advising, and mentorship.
