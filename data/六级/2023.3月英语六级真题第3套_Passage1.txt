In the digital age, the elderly often find themselves struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change. This phenomenon, known as the 'digital gap,' highlights the challenges older adults face in adapting to new technologies. Many seniors lack the necessary skills to use smartphones, computers, and online services, which can lead to social isolation and reduced access to essential services. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the inability to use digital health platforms left many elderly individuals without timely medical assistance. Addressing this gap requires concerted efforts from governments, communities, and families to provide tailored training and support, ensuring that the elderly can participate fully in the digital world.
