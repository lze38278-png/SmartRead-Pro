In the digital age, the way we consume information has undergone a profound transformation. Traditional media, such as newspapers and television, once dominated the flow of news and entertainment, but they are now increasingly supplemented—and sometimes supplanted—by online platforms. This shift has led to a more fragmented media landscape, where users can curate their own content feeds based on personal interests. While this offers greater autonomy and access to diverse viewpoints, it also poses risks, such as the creation of echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs and the spread of misinformation. Algorithms designed to maximize engagement often prioritize sensational or polarizing content, which can distort public discourse. To navigate this complex environment, media literacy has become an essential skill, enabling individuals to critically evaluate sources, recognize bias, and seek out reliable information. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with both consumers and creators to foster a healthier information ecosystem.
