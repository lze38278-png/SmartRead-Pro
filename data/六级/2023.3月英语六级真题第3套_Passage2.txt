Climate change is increasingly recognized as a critical threat to global biodiversity. Rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and extreme events are disrupting ecosystems and endangering countless species. For example, coral reefs, which support a quarter of marine life, are suffering from bleaching due to warmer ocean waters. Similarly, polar bears in the Arctic are losing their hunting grounds as sea ice melts. Conservation efforts must adapt to these changes by protecting habitats, reducing carbon emissions, and promoting sustainable practices. International cooperation is essential, as climate impacts transcend borders. By taking proactive measures, we can mitigate the effects of climate change and preserve the planet's rich biological heritage for future generations.
