The idea that animals can sense earthquakes has been around for centuries. In 373 B.C., historians recorded that animals, including rats, snakes, and weasels, deserted the Greek city of Helice days before a devastating earthquake. Similar reports have emerged from around the world ever since. But until recently, scientists were skeptical. Many argued that the evidence was anecdotal and that animals might be responding to other environmental changes, such as weather or human activity. In the past decade, however, researchers have started to take the idea more seriously. Some studies have shown that animals can detect subtle changes in the Earth's magnetic field or in the release of gases from the ground before an earthquake. For example, a 2010 study found that toads abandoned their breeding site in Italy days before a major earthquake, possibly because they sensed changes in groundwater chemistry. Other research has focused on how animals might use their keen senses of hearing, smell, or vibration detection to pick up early warning signs. Despite these findings, many scientists remain cautious. They note that predicting earthquakes is extremely difficult, and that animal behavior is often inconsistent. Moreover, it is hard to design controlled experiments to test the hypothesis. Still, some researchers believe that monitoring animal behavior could one day become part of an early warning system for earthquakes, especially in regions where seismic activity is common. "We're not saying that animals can predict earthquakes with 100 percent accuracy," said one scientist. "But they might give us a few hours' or days' notice, which could save lives."
